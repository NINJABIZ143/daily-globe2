        All that glitters is not gold under the powerful spotlights of Los Angeles.
        A confidential investigation has revealed that the flawless physiques of
        several A-list celebrities may hide an extreme nutritional experiment.

        Known as the “Zero-G Diet”, this controversial regime allegedly replaces
        traditional meals with synthetic capsules derived from aerospace research.
        Solid food is reportedly eliminated for periods exceeding thirty days.

        While celebrity agents attempt to downplay the issue as simple exhaustion,
        medical professionals warn that prolonged metabolic stress may cause
        irreversible consequences to long-term health.
